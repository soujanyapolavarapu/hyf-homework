        <h4>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h4>
        <p class="left-paragraph">Example of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
          led by web deb development include e-com-merce. Online auction
          sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and
          purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com
          and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and
          bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.</p>

        <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p class="increase-padding">Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
          growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
          businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
          services to customers.[1]</p>

        <p class="increase-padding">There is open source of software for web development like
          berkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and
          Perl?Plack. This has kept the cost of growth of the industry has
          been the rise of easy-to use WYSIWYG web web-development software,
          such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
          Knowledge of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
          languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can
          be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files,
          technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face training.</p>

        <p class="increase-padding">an ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
          build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
          now help to deliver applications as web services which were
          traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based
          computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize
          information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
          rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and
          Google Docs.These web services allow users to interact with
          applications form many locations, web services allow users to
          interact with applications from many locations, instead of being
          tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>
