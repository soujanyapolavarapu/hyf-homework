Hyderabadi biryani is one of India's most famous The key to a tasty spicy chicken curry recipe
Whether you use country chicken (naatu kodi) or broiler chicken, marination of the washed chicken pieces is important. Just salt, turmeric powder, and lemon juice will suffice. You can add a little ginger garlic paste, red chili powder and curd/yogurt also. But its optional. You need to marinate for at least 20 mins to an hour. This marination process will soften the chicken and give it a nice flavor.

The key to a tasty curry is freshly ground spices. I cannot emphasize this enough. The aroma and flavor are unbeatable.
For this spicy chicken curry, you have to use at least 6 to 8 fresh light green chilies. The chicken curry gets its addictive flavor from these green chilies.
The chicken should slow cook or simmer in the gravy to absorb all the flavors. You need to use bone-in chicken as boneless will not yield the same flavor as the former.
And the onions have to be sauteed beyond the ‘transparent’ stage or till lightly browned and once you add ginger garlic paste, continue to saute till the raw smell disappears and the oil separates. This is a very crucial process for making any Indian curry be it vegetarian or chicken.
